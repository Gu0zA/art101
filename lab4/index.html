		<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

		<div id ="p01">
		<p>The idea of this lab was to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>

		<div id ="p02">
		<p>There was a time we struggling between easier task or challenge task. We considered things such as Rocket Patrol.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Results</h3>

		<div id ="p03">
		<p>Finally, we decide to do a little challenge, which is, a Sokoban game. We actually have no idea whether we could finish this game but we just want to try a bit. We found many code about it and studied it to come out the pseudocode.</p>
